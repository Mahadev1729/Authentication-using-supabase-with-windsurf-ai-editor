Prompt 1:

1. I want to create a simple test website called “Web Auth” where users can create an account and log in to see content. Use only HTML and CSS.
2. Create a simple homepage that describes the website and encourages visitors to sign up to see the duck photo.
3. Create a dashboard page that shows a duck photo (Duck.JPEG).
4. Both homepage and dashboard pages will have the same styling.
5. Let’s do it slowly. Build those two pages first. Other pages and authentication logic will be added later.

Prompt 2:

1. Create sign up, sign in, check email confirmation, and reset password pages.
2. Make sure the design and styling is consistent across pages.
3. Don’t add authentication logic yet. We’ll do it later.
